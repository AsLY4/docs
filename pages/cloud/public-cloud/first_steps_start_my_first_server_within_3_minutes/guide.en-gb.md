## Preamble

Public Cloud allows you to easily and quickly create virtual servers (instances) at any time in just a few clicks. This guide will walk you through the creation of an instance.


### Prerequisites
- Log in to the OVH Customer [Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/cloud/){.external}
- [Create and configure a SSH key](../guide.en-gb.md){.ref} in your OVH Public Cloud control panel


## Creating the instance

You can then choose the instance type:

- The **VPS-SSD** range provides instances at a reduced price for limited requirements
- The **HG** range is based on CPU performance and provides instances with many high-frequency cores
- The **SP** range is based on RAM performance-and provides instances with optimized memory
- The **EG** range provides a balance of CPU/RAM, a good choice for general-purpose usage


### Choosing the operating system
Click on the distribution to display a new menu which will allow you to choose from a variety of the most popular operating systems such as Linux and Windows based systems provided by OVH, or even your own pre-saved snapshots.

For example: Select Ubuntu 16.04

> When creating an instance with monthly billing, you
> agree to pay for the service until the end of the current month. Be careful,
> this is an automatic renewal at the beginning of the next month.

Then (3) Click `Launch now`{.action}

The new instance will be available in minutes (the time required for transferring the system image and starting the operating system). This process usually takes less than 2 minutes.
