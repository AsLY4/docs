## Objective

Now that you have [created your pool](https://docs.ovh.com/ca/en/cloud-desktop-infrastructure/how-to-create-pool/){.external}, you can authorise user access to your virtual desktops.

**This guide will explain how to add users, and provide them with access to your virtual desktops.**


## Requirements

- You need to have created users in the Active Directory, if a [trust relationship has been created](https://docs.ovh.com/ca/en/cloud-desktop-infrastructure/approval-ad/){.external}, or created users via your [OVH Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager?action=gotomanager){.external}.
- You need to be logged in to the VMware Horizon 7.1 interface.



## Instructions

### Manage users

When the platform is delivered to you, 10 generic users (all named vdiXX, with XX representing a number) are created. Their login details are provided in the delivery email.


### Assign virtual desktop access to them

You will need to do this via VMware Horizon 7.1. Using the poolâ€™s `Entitlements`{.action} tab, you can associate users with certain permissions, giving them access to the virtual desktops you have deployed.

- Click `Add Entitlement`{.action} to open the context menu.

- Search and select the user(s) you would like to grant access to, then confirm.

The users associated with the pool can now [access and use your virtual desktops](https://docs.ovh.com/ca/en/cloud-desktop-infrastructure/accessing-desktop/){.external}.
