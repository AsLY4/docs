**Last updated 27th February, 2018**

## Objective

[Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash){.external} is an open source software developed by Elastic and allows you to send messages from different inputs to different types of output using different codecs, while processing them and transforming them in the process. You can learn a lot more about it on [the official website](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash){.external}.

This guide will show you how to deploy your personal Logstash with your own configuration to send your logs from any source to your stream directly on the Logs Data Platform.

## Requirements

If you are new to Logs Data Platform, you will have to complete this [Quick Start Tutorial](https://docs.ovh.com/fr/logs-data-platform/quick-start/){.external}

This is a rather long document but if you are already familiar with Logstash you can jump to the parts you're interested in :

- [What is Logstash?](#what-is-logstash){.external}
- [How do I configure Logstash Collector on Logs Data Platform?](#id2){.external}
- [What is special about our hosted Logstash? Available plugins, SSL Certificates and more.](#additional-information){.external}

This is "All you have to know about the Logstash Collector on the Logs Data Platform"!

## Instructions

### What is Logstash

Logstash is mainly a processing pipeline of data that allows you to get or receive information from a lot of sources and transform them if necessary before sending them to different types of software. In a configuration file you have 3 main parts to configure:

- The Input part: This part details where your logs come from. Some inputs wait for logs and some inputs are able to fetch them from a database for example.
- The Filter part: This part details how Logstash should parse and transform your logs messages.
- The Output part: This part specifies in which format to send logs and where to send them.

Here is a small configuration file so you get an idea :

```ruby
 #input
 #The input part just launch tcp server that will listen on port 4000
 #Each incoming line of log will be tagged as a syslog type.
 input {
     tcp {
         port => 4000
         type => syslog
     }
 }
 
 #Filter
 #The filter part applies a grok filter that will parse the message
 #It will also create new fields with information contained in the message.
 filter {
     grok {
         match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGBASE}" }
     }
     date {
         match => [ "timestamp", "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" ]
         target => "timestamp"
         timezone => "Europe/Paris"
     }
 }
 
 #Output
 #The output part will then encode everything in a gelf format and send it to Logs Data Platform  on the UDP GELF endpoint
 #Note that it will also add our token in the process.
 output {
     gelf {
         host => "<your_cluster>.logs.ovh.com"
         port => 2202
         custom_fields => ['X-OVH-TOKEN', 'da819874-5562-4a5f-b34e-fa8e708e8f16']
     }
 }
```

This is one example of configuration among others you can use in your own Logstash to send syslog type logs to the Logs Data Platform. There are a lot of filters and plugins available in Logstash, and the list is growing! For example, by sending these kinds of lines into this Logstash:

You will have the following result in your stream in Graylog :

![local\_logstash\_graylog](images/local_logstash_graylog.png){.thumbnail}

So, let's suppose you have a lot of hosts and you want to send all your syslog outputs to Logstash. One way to do it is to put one Logstash on one of your machines and send all the logs to this hosts. This will work but what happens if your hosts go down? Or is not fast enough? Or if it isn't compatible with Java? Don't worry, the best thing about the Logs Data Platform is that we can host your Logstash for you. We also allow you to configure the input and the filter as you wish and you can even define custom Groks. The next section will tell you how to do it!

### Host a Logstash collector on Logs Data Platform

The Logstash Collector comes with many advantages :

- The output part of the Logstash is automatically configured by us.
- You have your own certificate to enable SSL. This certificate can be used for example to trust only the TCP Inputs of your Logstash. This certificate and its associated key can be found at the following paths : **/etc/ssl/private/server.crt** for the cert and **/etc/ssl/private/server.key** for the key. The CA used to create these inputs is at the following location **/etc/ssl/private/ca.crt**. You will find this SSL CA for reference at the end of this document.
- And finally, we ensure that your collector  is always up and running 24/7.

To host this collector in the Logs Data Platform, you will need to configure it in the Logs Data Platform manager:

- Check the **Collectors** panel below the Stream one and click on the button **Host a new collector**.
- The Manager will then ask you to put a elegant name and a wonderful description.
- Select your Software : Select **Logstash 2.4**.
- Fill the main port of your input. We will put **4000** for now. Don't worry this is something you can change later.
- If your Logstash collector must be started with only one instance, use the single instance toggle. It concerns input plugins that will consume the data from its source by itself (like the [Twitter one](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/logs-data-platform/quick-start/){.external}).
- Finally select one of the stream you have to attach this collector to the stream you have. That means that every message that goes out of this collector is automatically routed to the stream. Click on the **Create this collector** button and TA-DA, your input is created.

![logstash_creation](images/logstash_created.png){.thumbnail}

Once created, you will have the hostname assigned to the Collector and a direct link to configure it. The Engine won't allow you to start it if you do not configure it properly. So let's do it!


#### Logstash Collector configuration

Click on Configuration to display the Logstash Configuration Page as follows :

![logstash_creation](images/config_logstash_1.png){.thumbnail}

There is 3 sections in this page :

- The Input section where you put the Input part of your configuration file.
- The Filter section where you put the filter part.
- The grok patterns sections where you can create your own grok patterns.

Note that unlike a classic config file, here you don't have to include the input configuration in a ruby hash

```ruby
input {
 
}
```
We will do it automatically for you.

If we take the configuration example above and if we enable the SSL encryption, we have that configuration for the Input Section :

```ruby
 tcp {
     port => 4000
     type => syslog
     ssl_enable => true
     ssl_cert => "/etc/ssl/private/server.crt"
     ssl_key => "/etc/ssl/private/server.key"
     ssl_extra_chain_certs => ["/etc/ssl/private/ca.crt"]
     ssl_verify => false
 }
```

![logstash_creation](images/input_section.png){.thumbnail}

As you can see, this is roughly the same configuration that before. The SSL configuration needs 5 extra parameters :

- **ssl_enable**: that allows to enable SSL. Must be set to 'true'.
- **ssl_cert**: the location of the auto-generated server certificate.
- **ssl_key**: the location of the associated key.
- **ssl_extra_chain_certs**: the array contains the path to the CA certificate.
- **ssl_verify**: this deactivates the client certificate verification that needs a trusted certificate on client side.

All the inputs have preconfigured SSL certificates at the fixed locations used in the configuration above. And for the filter part, you just have to copy and paste the previous configuration.

![logstash_creation](images/filter_section.png){.thumbnail}

The last section of the configuration is dedicated to custom Grok Filters. If you know about Grok, you can use this text area to create your own grok that you can use in the filter section above. It is an advanced usage of Logstash. Head to the end of the document to get some reference links that can help you use this functionality.

You can then click on **Save Logstash Configuration** and your Logstash is configured! You really want to click on **Start** but are we there yet? No, but we are almost there.

Many inputs like the redis one for example, fetch their own data from various sources. But in the case of the TCP Input, you need to tell us which port you want to open in your Collector. Moreover your collector will have a public IP, you don't want anyone to mess up with it. Don't worry you can further secure you input by whitelisting only a few IPs.

#### Collector Networking Configuration

To configure the network for your collector, please click on the **Network Configuration** button in the **...** menu. You will arrive at the network configuration page, where you will be able to specify which IPs or Subnet you allow to join your collector. Just add every entry you need by using the field and click on **Authorize**. You will have to do it for every IP or subnetwork you want to add. If the entry is successfully added, you will see the entry below. Use the **reject** button to delete the entry.

![network_input](images/network-input.png){.thumbnail}

That's all for the Network Configuration. You can go back to the Collectors page by using the link at the top.

#### Starting the input

Starting the input is done by using the **Start** Button in the **...** menu at the right of your input. Click on it to deploy your collector on Logs Data Platform.

![input_start](images/input_start.png){.thumbnail}

#### Collector informations

Once your collector is started, you can copy several informations into your clipboard.

- The hostname
- The public IP
- The SSL Certificate

The hostname is in the following form:

**<your_cluster>-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.<your_cluster>.logs.ovh.com**.

This is an address of your collector for the cluster on Logs Data Platform. Send your logs to your address to have them processed by your collector. Use for example the previous syslog Lines to test your collectors. If you head to Graylog, you will find your Logs in the attached Stream just as before.
